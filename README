Project: Event Processing POC
Create date: 11/21/12

Background
----------
1. This is a simple Event Processing Demonstration. The project contains a web-based producer, and a command-line consumer that simply echoes the messages it receives.
2. The web app uses HTML 5 so use a recent Firefox, Opera or Safari browser for best results.
3. The messaging platform is currently Apache MQ.

Instructions
------------
1. Install Jetty from http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/. The project currently assumes v6.1.4, but that's relatively arbitrary.
3. Install Apache Active MQ from http://activemq.apache.org/ and start it.
2. Import the Maven project into your favorite IDE and then execute the Lfecycle targets "clean" and "compile" from the Main module.
3. Execute the lifecycle target "install" for the Consumer. This will build and run the consumer. It will listen for messages continuously until you stop it.
4. Execute the Plug-in target "jetty-run" for the Producer. This will launch Jetty locally on port 8081.
5. Point your browser at http://localhost:8081/cep to access the producer web page. Fill out the form and start sending streams of simulated events.
6. Watch the Consumer console to see the messages arriving.
7. Take a look at the Apache MQ console at http://localhost:8161/admin and check out the topics tab.
